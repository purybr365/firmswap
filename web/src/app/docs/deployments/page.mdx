## Testnets

### Gnosis Chiado (Chain ID 10200)

| Contract | Address | Decimals |
|----------|---------|----------|

**Faucet**: [Chiado Faucet](https://faucet.chiadochain.net/) — get testnet xDAI for gas fees.

> The testnet tokens (tBRLA, tUSDC) are mock ERC-20 tokens deployed specifically for FirmSwap testing. They have no real value.

## Mainnets

Mainnet deployments are planned for the following chains. The FirmSwap contract uses the same bytecode across all chains — only the deployment address differs.

| Chain | Chain ID | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Gnosis | 100 | Planned |
| Base | 8453 | Planned |
| Polygon | 137 | Planned |
| Arbitrum | 42161 | Planned |
| Optimism | 10 | Planned |

Mainnet launch will be announced on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/purybr365/firmswap). Watch the repo for updates.

## Contract Verification

All FirmSwap contracts are verified on their respective block explorers. You can read and interact with the contract source code directly through the explorer interface.

The FirmSwap contract is:
- **Immutable** — no proxy pattern, no upgrade mechanism
- **Ownerless** — no admin functions, no owner address
- **Parameterized at compile time** — bond percentage (5%), minimum bond (1,000 USDC), and unstake delay (7 days) are constants
